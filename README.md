# There is Strength in Numbers: 
## A Comprehensive Study of Machine Learning Algorithms for Sex Identification on Animal Bone Remains

Abstract: 
This study explores the application of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms for predicting the sex of sheep using measurements of the talus bone in archaeozoological research. Leveraging data from well-documented sheep populations, we trained and tested various machine learning algorithms, such as kNN, SVMs, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, k-Means, DBSCAN, and GMM - demonstrating high accuracy in sex classification across multiple datasets from various time periods. We furthermore evaluate a variety of clustering results on unlabeled data and highlight their respective strengths and drawbacks. Our results suggest that machine learning offers a promising direction for enhancing the analysis of ancient and recent animal remains, providing valuable insights into past animal husbandry practices and their implications for understanding human history.

## Background

The Paper briefly summarizes the used and analysed Machine Learning algorithms. Due to space restrictions, the longer more detailed explanaition, aimed at people with little to no ML knowledge had to be omitted but can be included here for reference if needed.
The more detailed explanaition can be found [HERE](AdditionalBackground.md).

## Contents of this repository

All 'ipynb' (Python Notebook) files can be opened and reviewed here in GIT. Some of the figures from the paper as well as some additional figures can be found in the folder 'ResultsFigures'. 

## Installation and how to run Code on your machine

To run the provided Code in the Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps:
* Install Python (ideally 3.10 or higher) on your computer - Python can be downloaded from the official [Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Install the packages "jupyter notebook", "numpy", "pandas" "matplotlib" and "sklearn" - for example by opening a command line and running the command 'pip install yourPackagehere' (There might be more packages to install - if you get any errors while executing the notebooks, repeat this step with the required packages.)
* Using the command line, navigate to the cloned or downloaded repository and just run the command 'jupyter notebook'
* Your browser will open and a double click on any of the '.ipynb' files will open the notebook and give you the opportunity to try the code for yourself. 

## Known Issues

None so far, if you find any errors in the code, [please let me know](mailto:N.Schueler@lmu.de)!
